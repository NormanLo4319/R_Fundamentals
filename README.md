# R_Fundermentals
In this repository, we explore the R fundamentals and learn how to program with R.  We use the Integrated Development Environment, IDEs, ["R Studio"](https://rstudio.com/) in this project. We include the software installation instructions for R and R studio below for beginners.

## Installing R and R studio
R is an open-source software available for all commonly used operating system, including Windows, macOS, and Linus systems.  Note that RStudio is an R IDE that works with the version of R installed on your machine.  Therefore, we need to install R before installing RStudio to run the software.  To install R, you can find visit the [R-Project](https://www.r-project.org/) website and follow the instructions to install the software on your machine.  

Once R is installed on your machine, you can visit the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) website and follow the instructions to install the IDE on your machine. 

To start coding in R, we only need to start RStudio because it automatically runs the R software in the background and execute the code.  The RStudio interface is fairly intuitive to use and here is a picture to explain:
